# Alternative Layout Suggestions for AI Safety Paris

## Option 1: Clean Minimal with Dividers
**Desktop:**
- Remove card backgrounds entirely
- Use horizontal dividers (border lines) between sections
- Keep white/clean background throughout
- Use subtle spacing and typography hierarchy

**Mobile:**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Works perfectly, even simpler than desktop
- Dividers help separate sections without taking space
- No padding/margins from cards = more content visible
- Very fast to scroll through

**Benefits:** More spacious, less cluttered, easier to scan

---

## Option 2: Single Column Document Style ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Desktop:**
- Full-width content (still max-width constrained)
- Remove section backgrounds
- Use large headings as visual anchors
- Minimal borders, rely on whitespace

**Mobile:**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Single column is naturally mobile-first
- Already designed for narrow viewports
- Large headings create clear visual breaks
- No layout shifts between desktop/mobile
- Fastest to implement

**Benefits:** Very readable, focuses on content, modern aesthetic

---

## Option 3: Left Sidebar Navigation
**Desktop:**
- Sticky navigation menu on the left
- Main content flows naturally without cards
- Sections identified by subtle background color changes

**Mobile:**
- ⚠️ **COMPLEX** - Sidebar becomes hamburger menu or top bar
- Requires JavaScript for mobile nav
- Can feel disconnected from content
- More development work needed

**Benefits:** Easy navigation on desktop, professional look

---

## Option 4: Timeline/Vertical Flow
**Desktop:**
- Content flows top to bottom
- Small accent line on the left side connecting sections
- Icons or bullets mark each section

**Mobile:**
- ✅ **GOOD** - Timeline line becomes thinner or moves center
- Icons/bullets still work well
- Vertical flow is natural for mobile
- Visually interesting on small screens

**Benefits:** Guides the eye, clean progressive disclosure

---

## Option 5: Magazine/Editorial Style
**Desktop:**
- Asymmetric layout with varying widths
- Pull quotes and callouts instead of cards
- Large typography
- Image/logo placements integrated into flow

**Mobile:**
- ⚠️ **CHALLENGING** - Asymmetric layouts collapse to single column
- Loses visual interest on mobile
- Large typography can be hard to control
- Risk of awkward breaks

**Benefits:** Unique and engaging on desktop, editorial feel

---

## Option 6: Minimalist Swiss/Brutalist
**Desktop:**
- Black/white/one accent color only
- Heavy typography hierarchy
- No backgrounds or borders
- Grid-based layout

**Mobile:**
- ✅ **GOOD** - Bold typography works well on small screens
- High contrast = very readable
- Grid collapses to single column naturally
- Strong visual identity maintained

**Benefits:** Bold, memorable, focuses attention
